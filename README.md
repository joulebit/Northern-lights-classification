## Transfer Learning
Given the vast compute and time resources required to develop neural network models on computer vision, i will take advantage of a pretrained ResNet50. Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a model trained on one task is re-purposed on a second related task. It is done by removing the last layer which does the classification, and replacing it with your own last layer with the parameters you want to classify. Then you can train it on your new categories with just a fraction of the dataset.
